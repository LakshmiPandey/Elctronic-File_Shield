# Elctronic-File_Shield
Using Bluetooth of specific device providing file view (decrypt) and protecting the data of file via Rijndeal Algo .

 Here in the project
 
 1) Object of the project
 ==========================
   To secure the private information of users and their files and folder in system .
   And to provide accessibility only in presence of some specific keys.
   Else wise in their absence, save them as encrypted mode to enhance security.

 2) Implementation
 ==================
 the project has been developed in three steps-
 * Connecting the bluetooth of specific user.
 * Protecting the file via Rijndael algo.
 * Hiding the file for normal access and saving its credentials in database.

 5. Bluetooth
 ===============
* Bluetooth is the most commonly used technology for Point to Point short range of communication
   of wide range  devices for data tranfer and controls.
 * Besides from being commonly used, it also offers multi connection.

 4.Introduction to RIJNDAEL
============================

* Rijndael is the block cipher algorithm recently chosen as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).
* Therefore, the encryption or decryption of a block of data is accomplished by the iteration (a round)
* As input, Rijndael accepts one-dimensional 8-bit byte arrays that create data blocks.
* The plaintext is input and then mapped onto state bytes. The cipher key is also a one-dimensional 8-bit byte array.
* With an iterated block cipher, the different transformations operate in sequence on intermediate cipher results (states).
* The design of Rijndael is based on easily understandable mathematical concepts including finite field mathematics and
 linear algebra for matrix manipulation. of a specific transformation (a round function).

  Thus, coupling the widespread accessibility of Bluetooth and powerful block cipher algorithm of Rijndael,
  a Two Factor Authentication System [T-FA]  created which will not only overcome the disadvantages of passwords,
  but will also create much safe, protected emvironment and also will provide much better user inface system too.
